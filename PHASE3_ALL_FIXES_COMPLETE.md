## 🔍 Investigation Findings

### Root Causes Discovered

The fixes were actually IN the files, but the errors were in DIFFERENT locations than initially identified:

#### 1. Backtesting Error ✅ FIXED
**Location:** Line 502 (not line 460 as initially thought)  
**Issue:** `if drawdowns else 0` - checking numpy array as boolean  
**Fix:** `if len(drawdowns) > 0 else 0` + convert to float

#### 2. Betting Strategy Error ✅ FIXED  
**Location:** Line 186 in `_apply_risk_management`  
**Issue:** `current_drawdown = (self.peak_capital - self.current_capital) / self.peak_capital`  
**Fix:** Added zero-check for `peak_capital`

#### 3. Performance Metrics Error #1 ✅ FIXED
**Location:** Line 527 in `_calculate_overall_score`  
**Issue:** `self.config['metrics']['risk']` - KeyError when 'risk' not in config  
**Fix:** Added config existence check

#### 4. Performance Metrics Error #2 ✅ FIXED
**Location:** Line 749 in `generate_performance_report`  
**Issue:** `comparison['outperformance']` - KeyError when key doesn't exist  
**Fix:** Added existence checks for all comparison keys

## 🎯 Investigation Process

### Step 1: Verified Fixes Were in Files
- Used `grep` to confirm code changes
- All fixes were present in source files

### Step 2: Added Detailed Tracebacks
- Modified error handlers to show full stack traces
- Identified exact line numbers causing errors

### Step 3: Found Hidden Errors
- Discovered errors in different locations than expected
- Array boolean check on line 502 (not in loop)
- Division by zero in `_apply_risk_management` (not in Kelly)
- Config KeyError (not just metrics access)

### Step 4: Applied Additional Fixes
- Fixed all newly discovered issues
- Added defensive checks throughout

### Step 5: Verified Success
- Cleared Python cache
- Ran comprehensive test
- Confirmed zero errors
- Verified all components working

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Why Initial Fixes Didn't Work
1. **Multiple error sources** - Same error message from different locations
2. **Incomplete tracebacks** - Error handlers weren't showing full context
3. **Assumption errors** - Assumed error was in one place, was actually in another

### Investigation Techniques That Worked
1. ✅ **Adding detailed tracebacks** - Showed exact error locations
2. ✅ **Testing individual components** - Isolated which fixes worked
3. ✅ **Checking loaded code** - Verified fixes were actually present
4. ✅ **Systematic debugging** - Fixed one error at a time

### Best Practices Established
1. **Always add full tracebacks** to error handlers
2. **Test each fix individually** before moving to next
3. **Verify error location** with line numbers
4. **Check for multiple error sources** with same message
5. **Clear cache aggressively** when testing fixes
