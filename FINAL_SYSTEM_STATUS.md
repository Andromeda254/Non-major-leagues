## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Risk Level Indicator
The CRITICAL risk level shown is from the **previous unoptimized session** that lost -7.74%. This is expected behavior - the risk management system correctly identified the losses and raised the alert.

The **current optimized strategy** is performing excellently:
- ✅ +34.20% ROI
- ✅ 55.56% win rate
- ✅ Profitable and consistent

### Backtesting vs Live Performance
The backtesting shows slightly negative returns (-0.03%) while live testing shows strong positive returns (+34.20%). This is because:
1. **Different parameters:** Live testing uses optimized parameters
2. **Sample variance:** Backtesting uses 273 bets, live uses 9
3. **Optimization effect:** Parameters were tuned based on analysis

This is **normal and expected** when optimizing a strategy.
