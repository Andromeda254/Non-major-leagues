## üìà Performance Analysis

### Backtesting vs Live Trading

| Metric | Backtesting | Live Testing | Difference |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| **Return** | +4.45% | -7.74% | -12.19% |
| **Win Rate** | 37.74% | 28.57% | -9.17% |
| **Trades** | 265 | 7 | - |
| **Max DD** | 1.71% | 7.74% | +6.03% |

**Analysis:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Live performance worse than backtesting
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Small sample size (7 trades) not statistically significant
- ‚úÖ Risk management prevented catastrophic loss
- ‚úÖ System correctly identified high-risk situation

**Recommendations:**
1. Increase sample size (need 50+ trades for significance)
2. Review confidence thresholds
3. Analyze losing trades for patterns
4. Consider adjusting position sizing
5. Monitor for overfitting from Phase 2
